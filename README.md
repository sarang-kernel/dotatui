# `dotatui` - A Dotfile-Focused Git TUI

**dotatui** is a fast, terminal-based UI for managing git repositories, written in Rust. Inspired by the convenience of `lazygit` and the aesthetics of `lazyvim`, its primary focus is to provide a streamlined workflow for managing system dotfiles and configurations.

- **Mouse Support:** Click to select files and change panel focus, and use the scroll wheel to navigate lists.

## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites

You need the Rust toolchain and the `libgit2` development library installed on your system.

**1. Install Rust:**
If you don't have Rust, install it via `rustup`:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

**2. Install `libgit2`:**

- **Debian / Ubuntu:**
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install -y pkg-config libssl-dev libgit2-dev
  ```
- **Arch Linux:**
  ```bash
  sudo pacman -S pkg-config openssl libgit2
  ```
- **macOS (Homebrew):**
  ```bash
  brew install libgit2
  ```
- **Windows:** Installation is more complex. Please follow the instructions on the [`git2-rs` repository](https://github.com/rust-lang/git2-rs#windows).

### From Source (Current Method)

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/dotatui.git
    cd dotatui
    ```

2.  Build the release binary:

    ```bash
    cargo build --release
    ```

3.  The executable will be located at `./target/release/dotatui`. For easy access, move it to a directory in your system's `PATH`:
    ```bash
    sudo mv ./target/release/dotatui /usr/local/bin/
    ```

### From Crates.io (Coming Soon)

Once published, installation will be as simple as:

```bash
cargo install dotatui
```
