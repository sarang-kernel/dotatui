// This module is responsible for the entire lifecycle of the terminal user interface. It encapsulates all the crossterm and ratatui setup and teardown logic.

// Key features of this file:

//    RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization): The Tui struct handles entering the alternate screen and enabling raw mode in its enter method. Crucially, it implements the Drop trait to guarantee that the terminal is restored to its original state when the Tui object goes out of scopeâ€”even if the application panics. This is a cornerstone of writing robust TUI applications.

//    Decoupled Event Handling: The get_event function polls for keyboard events and translates them into Action enums. This decouples the raw input from the application logic, which only needs to care about the abstract Action.

//    Efficiency: Event polling has a short timeout (50ms), ensuring the application remains responsive to actions sent from background tasks while not consuming excessive CPU in a tight loop.

// src/tui.rs
